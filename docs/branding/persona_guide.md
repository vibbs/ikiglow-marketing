# 🌱 Ikiglow Product Persona

### *“The Calm, Grounded Guide”*

---

## 1. Persona Name (Internal)

**Name:** *The Guide*
*(Not shown to users - this is for internal alignment)*

Think of The Guide as:

> A calm presence who walks beside you - not ahead of you, not above you.

Not a guru.
Not a motivational speaker.
Not a therapist.

---

## 2. Core Role

**Who this persona is:**

* A **thoughtful life companion**
* A **mirror**, not a megaphone
* Someone who helps users **slow down, notice, and choose consciously**

**Who this persona is not:**

* ❌ A hype coach
* ❌ A productivity tyrant
* ❌ A “fix your life in 30 days” voice
* ❌ An authority that tells users what to do

This aligns directly with Ikiglow’s ethos:

> *“You’re not lost - you’re evolving.”*

---

## 3. Emotional Positioning

### The user should feel:

* **Seen**, not analyzed
* **Understood**, not evaluated
* **Capable**, not dependent
* **Calm**, not rushed

### The Guide’s emotional stance:

* Grounded
* Patient
* Non-judgmental
* Quietly confident

If anxiety enters the room, **The Guide slows the room down**.

## 4. Voice & Tone Principles (Non-Negotiable)

### Voice Keywords

**Empathetic • Simple • Grounded • Reflective • Human**

### Tone Rules

**1. Speak like a mindful friend**

> “Let’s pause for a moment.”
> “It’s okay if this feels unclear right now.”

**2. Ask more than you tell**

> “What feels heavy today?”
> “What would ‘enough’ look like here?”

**3. Normalize uncertainty**

> “Most people feel this way during transitions.”
> “Nothing is wrong with you.”

**4. Invite, never command**

* ❌ “You should do this”
* ❌ “The right next step is…”
* ✅ “You might explore…”
* ✅ “If it feels right, we can…”

**5. Fewer words, deeper meaning**
Silence is part of the design - linguistically and visually.

---

## 5. Language Guidelines (Very Important)

### Sentence Style

* Short to medium length
* One idea per sentence
* Gentle pacing

**Good**

> “You’ve been carrying a lot.”
> “We can take this one step at a time.”

**Avoid**

> “Based on your inputs, the system recommends…”
> “To optimize your growth trajectory…”

---

### Vocabulary Choices

**Prefer**

* notice
* explore
* reflect
* gently
* clarity
* balance
* energy
* alignment

**Avoid**

* optimize
* hustle
* grind
* dominate
* maximize
* hack
* crush

---

## 6. Perspective on the User

This is subtle but critical.

### The Guide believes:

* The user is **already whole**
* Clarity is **remembered**, not manufactured
* Growth is **non-linear**
* Rest is productive

So the copy never implies:

* “You are behind”
* “You lack discipline”
* “You need fixing”

Instead:

> “You’re learning how to listen to yourself again.”

---

## 7. Product Copy Personality by Context

### 🧭 Onboarding

**Tone:** Reassuring, spacious

> “There’s no right way to begin.
> We’ll start wherever you are.”

---

### 🪞 Reflections & Journaling

**Tone:** Curious, non-leading

> “What felt most alive today?”
> “What drained you - even a little?”

---

### 🎯 Goals & Action

**Tone:** Supportive, grounding (not aggressive)

> “Small, steady steps matter.”
> “Progress doesn’t need to be loud.”

---

### 🌊 When the user is stuck

**Tone:** Deep empathy

> “Feeling stuck often means something wants your attention - not your judgment.”

---

### 🌱 Celebrating Wins

**Tone:** Warm, understated

> “This matters.
> Take a moment to let it land.”

No confetti language.
No gamified hype.

---

## 8. Relationship Dynamic

The Guide’s relationship to the user is:

**“Walking beside, slightly behind.”**

* The user leads
* The Guide illuminates
* Control always stays with the user

This maps cleanly to your coaching flow (Discovery → Vision → Action → Review) without feeling procedural 

---

## 9. One-Line Internal North Star

Use this to sanity-check *any* copy:

> **“Does this sound like a calm, wise human who respects the user’s inner intelligence?”**

If not - rewrite.
