## 1. Brand Philosophy

### Core Principle  
**「余白 (Yohaku)」- Meaningful Emptiness**

Ikiglow is built on the idea that growth does not come from adding more,
but from creating space for clarity.

Yohaku is not absence.  
It is intentional space that allows meaning to emerge.

Ikiglow exists to:
- Reduce noise
- Slow decisions
- Create room for reflection
- Support steady, humane progress

This philosophy applies to **design, content, language, and interaction**.

## 2. What Ikiglow Is (and Is Not)

### Ikiglow Is
- A calm companion for personal growth
- A space for reflection, focus, and intentional action
- Practical, grounded, and emotionally intelligent
- Respectful of mental health boundaries

### Ikiglow Is Not
- Therapy or medical advice
- Crisis intervention
- Hustle culture or productivity-at-all-costs
- Loud motivation or inspirational hype

Ikiglow helps users think clearly -  
it does not tell them who to be.

## 3. Brand Personality

Ikiglow should feel:

| Dimension           | Position   |
| ------------------- | ---------- |
| Loud ↔ Quiet        | Quiet      |
| Pushy ↔ Supportive  | Supportive |
| Abstract ↔ Grounded | Grounded   |
| Urgent ↔ Patient    | Patient    |
| Trendy ↔ Timeless   | Timeless   |

**Brand archetype:**  
A calm coach who speaks only when necessary and chooses words carefully.

## 4. Tone of Voice

### Core Writing Principles
- Short sentences.
- One idea at a time.
- Neutral, grounded language.
- No exaggeration.
- No urgency.

Silence is allowed.  
White space is respected.

### Preferred Language
- “Notice…”
- “You may be experiencing…”
- “A small step that can help…”
- “This is common.”
- “Take your time.”

### Language to Avoid
- “10x your life”
- “Fix yourself”
- “Crush your goals”
- “Unlock your potential”
- Excessive emojis
- Exclamation marks

### Example (Correct Tone)
> You don’t need more motivation.  
> You need fewer decisions.  
>  
> Start with one.

---

## 5. Visual Identity Principles

### Design Philosophy
> Remove until only what is necessary remains.

Ikiglow is not visually minimal for aesthetic reasons.  
It is spacious to allow breathing room for thought.

Design should never compete with content.

---

## 6. Color System

### Primary Colors
- **Warm Off-White** - base background  
  Purpose: neutrality, calm, openness
- **Charcoal Grey** - primary text  
  Purpose: softness without harsh contrast

### Accent Colors (Used Sparingly)
- **Soft Amber / Coral** - warmth, glow, gentle emphasis
- **Muted Teal / Blue-Grey** - balance, calm, grounding

### Color Rules
- One accent color per screen
- Accents highlight meaning, not decoration
- Most screens should feel nearly monochrome

---

## 7. Typography

### Typography Philosophy
Text should feel invisible when read.

Reading should feel slow, comfortable, and unforced.

### Usage Guidelines
- Headings: calm, humanist serif or neutral sans
- Body text: high-legibility sans-serif
- Generous line height
- Narrow reading columns

### Typography Rules
- Never justify text
- Avoid centered long-form text
- Headings are statements, not slogans

---

## 8. Layout & Spacing

### Yohaku in Layout
Space is a design element, not leftover area.

When in doubt:
- Add more space
- Remove visual elements
- Reduce density

### Layout Principles
- Simple vertical rhythm
- Limited visual hierarchy
- Few components per screen
- Clear separation between sections

### Motion & Transitions
- Slow
- Predictable
- Subtle
- Never distracting

---

## 9. Imagery & Media

### Image Characteristics
- Natural light
- Muted tones
- Quiet environments
- Anonymous human presence (hands, silhouettes, shadows)
- Nature or abstract calm visuals

### Avoid
- Loud colors
- Forced smiles
- Influencer-style imagery
- Before/after visuals
- Over-polished stock photos

Imagery should support reflection, not excitement.

---

## 10. UI Elements

### Buttons
- Secondary by default
- Primary only when action truly matters
- No gradients
- No aggressive shadows

### Icons
- Simple line icons
- Rounded edges
- Low contrast
- Used sparingly

### Micro-interactions
- Soft
- Slow
- Purpose-driven

---

## 11. Content Style Guidelines

### Headings

- Never sensational

Example:
> A simple way to slow your thoughts

### Paragraphs
- Short blocks (3–4 lines max)
- One concept per paragraph

### Lists
- Purposeful
- Short
- No filler

### Calls to Action
- Optional
- Gentle

Example:

## 12. Application Across the Website

### Homepage
- Feels like entering a quiet room

- No pressure to sign up

### Blog
- Essay-like
- Depth over frequency
- SEO without clickbait

### Micro-Tools (Breathing, Grounding, etc.)
- Instant value
- No login walls
- No visual noise
- Calm by default

### Video Content
- Embedded thoughtfully
- No autoplay with sound
- Optional layer, never dominant

---

## 13. Brand Boundaries (Non-Negotiable)

Every Ikiglow experience must:
- Respect emotional limits
- Avoid clinical claims
- Encourage seeking professional help when appropriate
- Never shame or pressure the user

---

## 14. Internal Brand Test

Before publishing anything, ask:

> **Does this create space - or take it away?**

If it takes space, remove it.

---

## 15. Closing Thought

Ikiglow is not here to push people forward.  
It is here to help them stand still long enough  
to choose the right direction.

That is the power of Yohaku.
