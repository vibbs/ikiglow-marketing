## Exercise

Welcome to the self-compassion break. This is a gentle practice for responding to pain, difficulty, or self-criticism with kindness.

[pause 2s]

Find a comfortable seat. Place a hand on your heart if that feels right.

[pause 2s]

You don't need to be hard on yourself.

[pause 3s]

This practice has three steps. Acknowledgment. Common humanity. Kindness.

[pause 2s]

Let's begin.

[pause 3s]

First, acknowledge the difficulty. You don't have to name it out loud. Just notice it.

[pause 2s]

This is a moment of suffering.

[pause 3s]

Whatever you're feeling—frustration, sadness, shame, fear—it's real. You don't have to fix it. Just notice it.

[pause 4s]

Place a hand on your heart if that feels supportive. Feel the warmth. The rhythm.

[pause 4s]

You're allowed to struggle.

[pause 4s]

Now, the second step. Remember you are not alone.

[pause 2s]

Struggle is part of being human.

[pause 3s]

Everyone experiences pain. Everyone feels lost sometimes. Everyone doubts themselves.

[pause 3s]

You are not broken. You are not uniquely flawed. You are human.

[pause 4s]

This difficulty you're feeling? Countless others have felt it too. You're not alone in this.

[pause 4s]

Now, the third step. Offer yourself kindness.

[pause 2s]

May I be kind to myself.

[pause 3s]

You can use these words, or choose your own. Whatever feels supportive.

[pause 2s]

May I be patient with myself.

[pause 3s]

May I give myself the compassion I need.

[pause 3s]

May I accept myself as I am.

[pause 4s]

Repeat the phrase that resonates most. Let it settle.

[pause 5s]

You met yourself with kindness.

[pause 3s]

This is the practice. Return to it when you need it.

## How to Use

This practice is designed for moments when you're being hard on yourself—when you've made a mistake, when you feel inadequate, when self-criticism feels louder than self-support.

[pause 2s]

You can use it anywhere. Sitting, standing, or lying down. You can speak the phrases aloud or silently in your mind.

[pause 2s]

Move through each of the three steps slowly. Acknowledge the difficulty. Remember your shared humanity. Offer yourself kindness.

[pause 2s]

You don't have to believe the words immediately. Just say them. Let them be a gentle offering to yourself.

[pause 2s]

Over time, this practice softens the inner critic. It teaches you to respond to pain the way you would respond to a friend.

## Why It Helps

Self-compassion reduces anxiety, shame, and self-criticism. Research shows it activates the same calming response in your brain as receiving care from someone else.

[pause 2s]

When you acknowledge your pain without judgment, when you remember that struggle is universal, when you speak kindly to yourself—you shift from isolation to connection.

[pause 2s]

You are not trying to make the pain go away. You're just meeting it with softness instead of harshness.

[pause 2s]

You deserve the same kindness you give others. You deserve patience. You deserve care.

[pause 3s]

This practice is a way of giving that to yourself.
