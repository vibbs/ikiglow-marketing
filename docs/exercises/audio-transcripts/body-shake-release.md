## Exercise

Welcome to body shake and release. This is a somatic practice to discharge stuck energy and reset your nervous system through movement.

[pause 2s]

Find a place where you can stand comfortably and move freely. If you feel self-conscious, find somewhere private.

[pause 2s]

Let the body release first.

[pause 3s]

Stand with your feet hip-width apart. Take a breath.

[pause 3s]

Now, shake out your hands and wrists. Let them be loose. Let them flop.

[pause 8s]

Good. Now let the shake move up your arms. Loose. Light. No control.

[pause 8s]

Let it travel into your shoulders. Shake them out. Let go of any tightness.

[pause 8s]

Now bounce gently on your knees. Let your whole body shake. Your arms, your shoulders, your torso. Everything.

[pause 8s]

Keep going. Let it be playful. Let it be messy. There's no right way to do this.

[pause 8s]

Feel the energy moving. Feel the tension releasing.

[pause 8s]

Keep shaking. Let your jaw go slack. Let your face soften.

[pause 8s]

A few more seconds. Let it all out.

[pause 8s]

Good. Now begin to slow down. Smaller movements. Gentler.

[pause 5s]

And come to stillness.

[pause 4s]

Stand here for a moment. Notice how your body feels. Notice the warmth. The aliveness.

[pause 4s]

You moved the energy. You released what was stuck.

[pause 3s]

Take one deep breath in... and let it go.

## How to Use

This practice works best when you feel stuck, restless, or like energy is trapped in your body.

[pause 2s]

You can use it after stress, after sitting too long, or when you notice tension building but don't know how to release it.

[pause 2s]

Stand somewhere you can move freely. If you feel self-conscious, close the door or go outside.

[pause 2s]

Let the movement be loose and uncontrolled. Shake for at least thirty seconds, longer if it feels good. You'll know when you're done.

[pause 2s]

This isn't about looking graceful. It's about letting your body do what it needs to do.

## Why It Helps

Shaking mimics the body's natural stress discharge. Animals do this instinctively after a threat passes—they shake, then return to calm.

[pause 2s]

When we experience stress or fear, energy gets stuck in our muscles. We hold tension without realizing it. Shaking releases that energy and resets your nervous system.

[pause 2s]

It's fast. It's simple. And it works because you're working with your body, not against it.

[pause 2s]

You don't need to understand why it works. You just need to let yourself move.

[pause 3s]

Your body knows what to do. Trust it.
