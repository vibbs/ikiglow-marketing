## Exercise

Welcome to coherent breathing. This is a calm, balanced rhythm—six counts in, six counts out—to steady your focus and settle your emotions.

[pause 2s]

Find a comfortable seat. Let your spine lengthen, your shoulders drop.

[pause 2s]

This practice is simple. Breathe in for six counts. Breathe out for six counts. Equal. Smooth. Like a gentle wave.

[pause 3s]

Bring your attention here.

Let's begin.

[pause 2s]

When you're ready to finish, take one more breath in... and gently release.

[pause 3s]

Notice the steadiness. The calm. You can return to your task now, carrying this rhythm with you.

## How to Use

This practice is an easy reset between tasks, meetings, or moments when your attention feels scattered.

[pause 2s]

You can use it anytime you need to feel centered. Breathe in for six counts, then out for six counts. Keep the breath soft and smooth, like a gentle wave.

[pause 2s]

Stay for a few minutes, then return to what you were doing. You'll likely notice your mind feels clearer, your emotions more steady.

[pause 2s]

This practice doesn't require perfection. It just requires presence.

## Why It Helps

Coherent breathing supports what's called heart rate variability—the natural rhythm between your heartbeat and your breath. When these two rhythms align, your body finds balance.

[pause 2s]

A steady, equal breath improves attention, reduces emotional reactivity, and creates a sense of inner calm.

[pause 2s]

This practice is backed by research. Five to six breaths per minute—about six seconds in, six seconds out—is the rhythm that most reliably shifts your nervous system toward coherence.

[pause 2s]

You're not trying to control your thoughts. You're just giving your body a gentle, reliable rhythm to follow. And in that rhythm, clarity often arrives on its own.

[pause 3s]

This is a practice you can return to, again and again. It's always here.
