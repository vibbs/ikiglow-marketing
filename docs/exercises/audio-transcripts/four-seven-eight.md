## Exercise

Welcome to 4-7-8 breathing. This is a soothing cadence designed to quiet your body and invite sleepiness.

[pause 2s]

Find a comfortable position. You can sit, or lie down if you're winding down for rest.

[pause 2s]

This practice uses three phases. A gentle inhale for four counts. A steady hold for seven counts. And a long, releasing exhale for eight counts.

[pause 2s]

The extended exhale is where the magic happens. It shifts your nervous system toward rest.

[pause 3s]

There's nowhere else to be.

[pause 2s]

Let's begin.

[pause 2s]

Breathe in... two... three... four.

[pause 1s]

Hold... two... three... four... five... six... seven.

[pause 1s]

Breathe out... two... three... four... five... six... seven... eight.

[pause 2s]

Breathe in... two... three... four.

[pause 1s]

Hold... two... three... four... five... six... seven.

[pause 1s]

Breathe out... two... three... four... five... six... seven... eight.

[pause 2s]

Breathe in... two... three... four.

[pause 1s]

Hold... two... three... four... five... six... seven.

[pause 1s]

Breathe out... two... three... four... five... six... seven... eight.

[pause 2s]

Breathe in... two... three... four.

[pause 1s]

Hold... two... three... four... five... six... seven.

[pause 1s]

Breathe out... two... three... four... five... six... seven... eight.

[pause 3s]

You can continue this rhythm for as many rounds as you need. Four to six cycles is often enough.

[pause 2s]

When you're ready to finish, take one more gentle breath in... and let it all go.

[pause 4s]

Notice the softness. The stillness. You're safe here.

## How to Use

This practice is especially helpful before sleep, or during moments of high anxiety.

[pause 2s]

You can use it anytime you need to shift from activation to rest. Sit comfortably, or lie down if you're preparing for sleep.

[pause 2s]

Let the long exhale soften your shoulders and jaw. Don't force the breath—just guide it gently.

[pause 2s]

Repeat for four to six rounds, then pause. Notice how your body feels.

[pause 2s]

If sleepiness comes, welcome it. This is your body learning to rest.

## Why It Helps

The 4-7-8 pattern works because the exhale is longer than the inhale. This tells your parasympathetic nervous system—the part responsible for rest—that it's safe to slow down.

[pause 2s]

The gentle hold between breaths builds a sense of steadiness. You're not rushing. You're not forcing. You're just breathing.

[pause 2s]

This practice can lower your heart rate, reduce mental chatter, and ease you into a state of calm.

[pause 2s]

It's especially powerful before bed, but you can use it anytime anxiety feels too loud. Your breath is a bridge from stress to stillness.

[pause 3s]

You always have this tool. It's always here.
