## Exercise

Welcome to 5-4-3-2-1 grounding. This is a sensory practice to anchor your attention in the present moment.

[pause 2s]

When your mind feels scattered or anxious, this practice brings you back to what's real, what's here, what's now.

[pause 2s]

You don't need to change anything. You just need to notice.

[pause 3s]

Let's begin.

[pause 2s]

First, name five things you can see around you. Take your time. Look for small details you might usually miss.

[pause 3s]

What do you see? The light on the wall. A book. Your hands. The corner of a window. A shadow.

[pause 8s]

Good. Now, name four things you can touch. You can reach out and feel them, or just notice what you're already touching.

[pause 3s]

The chair beneath you. Your breath moving in your chest. The floor under your feet. The fabric of your clothes.

[pause 8s]

Good. Now, name three things you can hear. Listen closely. Notice the quiet sounds underneath the obvious ones.

[pause 3s]

Birds outside. Your breathing. Distant traffic. The hum of the room.

[pause 8s]

Good. Now, name two things you can smell. If you can't smell anything right now, that's okay. Notice what you remember, or what the air feels like.

[pause 3s]

Fresh air. Coffee. Or maybe nothing at all. Just the neutrality of the space.

[pause 6s]

Finally, name one thing you can taste. The lingering taste of tea. The inside of your mouth. Or just the sensation of your tongue resting.

[pause 4s]

You are here. You are present.

[pause 3s]

Take a moment to notice how you feel now.

[pause 4s]

You didn't have to go anywhere. You just had to arrive.

## How to Use

This practice is designed for moments when anxiety feels overwhelming, or when your thoughts are spinning and you can't find solid ground.

[pause 2s]

You can use it anywhere. In a waiting room, at your desk, in the middle of a crowded space. No one needs to know you're practicing.

[pause 2s]

Start when you're ready. Notice each sense without judgment. Move through the steps at your own pace. There's no rush.

[pause 2s]

You don't have to write anything down, but if it helps to speak the words aloud or in your head, do that.

[pause 2s]

The practice is simply noticing. That's all.

## Why It Helps

The 5-4-3-2-1 method interrupts racing thoughts by shifting your focus from your mind to your senses. When you name what you see, hear, touch, smell, and taste, you anchor yourself in what's real and immediate.

[pause 2s]

Sensory attention pulls you out of mental loops—the what-ifs, the worst-case scenarios, the replays of past mistakes. It brings you here.

[pause 2s]

You're not trying to stop the anxiety. You're just giving yourself something else to focus on. And often, that's enough for the intensity to soften.

[pause 2s]

This is a practice you can return to again and again. Whenever you feel unmoored, use your senses to find your way back.

[pause 3s]

You are here. You are safe. You are present.
