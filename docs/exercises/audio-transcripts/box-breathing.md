## Exercise

Welcome to box breathing. This is a steady, four-part rhythm to quiet your mind and settle your nervous system.

Find a comfortable seat. Let your shoulders soften.

[pause 2s]

When you're ready, we'll breathe together through four equal phases. Inhale, hold, exhale, and rest. Each phase lasts four seconds.

[pause 2s]

There's nothing to force. Just follow the rhythm.

[pause 3s]

Let's begin.

[pause 2s]

Breathe in... two... three... four.

[pause 1s]

Hold... two... three... four.

[pause 1s]

Breathe out... two... three... four.

Rest... two... three... four.

[pause 2s]

When you're ready to finish, take one more full breath in... and let it go.

[pause 3s]

Notice how you feel. Your breath is always here when you need to return.

## How to Use

This practice is designed to steady your attention when thoughts feel rushed or scattered.

[pause 2s]

You can use this exercise anytime you notice mental spinning or anxiety rising. It works especially well before meetings, decisions, or moments when you need to feel grounded.

[pause 2s]

Begin when you're ready. You don't need to count in your head—just follow the voice and the visual rhythm. Stay for a few cycles, or as long as feels right.

[pause 2s]

There's no right or wrong. The practice is simply showing up for your breath.

## Why It Helps

Box breathing uses four equal phases to create a consistent, predictable rhythm. This steadiness signals safety to your nervous system.

[pause 2s]

When each phase is balanced—inhale, hold, exhale, rest—your body begins to relax. Your heart rate steadies. The mental spiral slows.

[pause 2s]

This isn't about controlling your breath. It's about giving yourself a gentle anchor when everything else feels uncertain.

[pause 2s]

You're not trying to fix anything. You're just breathing. And sometimes, that's enough.
