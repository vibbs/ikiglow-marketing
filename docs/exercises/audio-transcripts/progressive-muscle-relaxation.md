## Exercise

Welcome to progressive muscle relaxation. This is a guided wind-down to ease physical tension and prepare your body for sleep.

[pause 2s]

Find a comfortable position. You can lie down or sit with your back supported.

[pause 2s]

Close your eyes if that feels right.

[pause 3s]

There's nowhere else to be.

[pause 2s]

In this practice, you'll tense each part of your body for a few seconds, then release. The contrast between tension and release helps your muscles let go.

[pause 2s]

Let's begin.

[pause 3s]

Bring your attention to your feet and toes. Curl your toes and tense your feet. Hold... two... three. Now release. Let them go completely.

[pause 4s]

Notice the difference. The softness. The warmth.

[pause 4s]

Now your calves. Tighten your calf muscles. Hold... two... three. Release. Feel them soften.

[pause 4s]

Notice the heaviness.

[pause 4s]

Now your thighs. Tense them. Hold... two... three. Let them go heavy and relaxed.

[pause 4s]

Feel the weight sinking.

[pause 4s]

Now your glutes and hips. Squeeze your glutes. Hold... two... three. Release completely.

[pause 4s]

Let the tension melt.

[pause 4s]

Now your abdomen. Pull your belly in tight. Hold... two... three. Let it soften and expand.

[pause 4s]

Feel the breath moving freely.

[pause 4s]

Now your hands and arms. Make fists and tighten your arms. Hold... two... three. Release. Feel warmth spread through your hands.

[pause 4s]

Notice the lightness.

[pause 4s]

Now your shoulders. Lift them toward your ears. Hold... two... three. Drop them. Feel the tension melt away.

[pause 4s]

Let them be heavy.

[pause 4s]

Now your neck. Gently press your head back. Hold... two... three. Release. Let your neck lengthen.

[pause 4s]

Feel the space.

[pause 4s]

Finally, your face. Scrunch your face tight. Hold... two... three. Release. Let your jaw drop open.

[pause 4s]

Feel the softness.

[pause 5s]

Your body is relaxed. Notice the heaviness. The warmth. Let yourself rest.

[pause 6s]

You can stay here as long as you need. Let sleep come when it's ready.

## How to Use

This practice is designed to ease you into sleep, especially when your body feels tense or your mind is restless.

[pause 2s]

You can use it in bed, right before sleep, or anytime you need deep physical relaxation.

[pause 2s]

Lie down or sit in a comfortable position. Move through each body part slowly. Tense for three to five seconds, then fully release.

[pause 2s]

The practice works because it teaches your body the difference between tension and relaxation. Often, we hold tension without realizing it. This makes it visible—and then lets it go.

[pause 2s]

If you fall asleep before finishing, that's perfect. That's the goal.

## Why It Helps

Progressive muscle relaxation signals your body that it's safe to rest. It reduces physical tension that blocks sleep and quiets a racing mind by giving it a structured focus.

[pause 2s]

When you tense and release each muscle group, you activate your parasympathetic nervous system—the part responsible for rest and repair.

[pause 2s]

This practice doesn't force sleep. It just creates the conditions for it. It tells your body: you're safe. You can let go. You can rest.

[pause 2s]

Over time, this practice trains your body to relax more easily. It becomes a signal—a ritual that says, "It's time to sleep."

[pause 3s]

You deserve rest. Your body knows how. This practice just reminds it.
