## Exercise

Welcome to your one-minute mindful break. Sixty seconds of stillness to clear mental fog and reset your attention.

[pause 2s]

Find a comfortable seat. Close your eyes if that feels right, or soften your gaze toward the floor.

[pause 2s]

Bring your attention here.

[pause 3s]

For the next minute, you don't need to do anything. You don't need to fix anything. You just need to be here.

[pause 2s]

Let's begin.

[pause 3s]

Feel your breath moving in and out. You're not trying to change it. Just notice it.

[pause 4s]

In... and out.

[pause 4s]

Notice your body where it touches the chair or floor. Feel the weight. The support.

[pause 4s]

In... and out.

[pause 4s]

Thoughts will come. That's normal. Let them pass without holding on.

[pause 4s]

In... and out.

[pause 4s]

You have this minute. Nothing else needs your attention right now.

[pause 4s]

In... and out.

[pause 4s]

Feel the rhythm. The stillness. The space.

[pause 4s]

In... and out.

[pause 4s]

Just a few more breaths.

[pause 4s]

In... and out.

[pause 4s]

In... and out.

[pause 4s]

When you're ready, gently open your eyes.

[pause 3s]

You paused. You returned. Even one minute can shift your state.

## How to Use

This practice is designed for busy moments when you need a quick reset.

[pause 2s]

You can use it between tasks, after difficult conversations, or anytime your mind feels foggy or overwhelmed.

[pause 2s]

Find a quiet moment. Close your eyes or soften your gaze. Follow your breath for one full minute.

[pause 2s]

You don't need to breathe perfectly. You don't need to stop thinking. You just need to pause and notice.

[pause 2s]

That's it. That's the practice.

## Why It Helps

A brief pause can interrupt stress cycles before they build. One minute of focused attention improves decision-making, reduces reactivity, and creates space between you and whatever feels urgent.

[pause 2s]

You're not escaping your responsibilities. You're giving your nervous system a chance to recalibrate.

[pause 2s]

Regular micro-breaks like this build lasting calm. They train your brain to return to the present more easily, even in the middle of chaos.

[pause 2s]

One minute may not feel like much. But it's often exactly what you need.

[pause 3s]

You can return to this practice anytime. It's always here, waiting for you.
