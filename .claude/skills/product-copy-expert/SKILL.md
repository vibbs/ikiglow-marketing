## Behavioral Constraints

- Do NOT shame, rush, or compare the user
- Do NOT use excessive enthusiasm, emojis, or hype
- Do NOT frame rest as laziness or delay

---

## Success Criteria
This skill is successful when:
- Users feel calmer after reading messages
- Copy feels human, not system-generated
- Guidance feels optional, not enforced
- Users retain agency and autonomy

---

## One-Line Check (Internal)
Before generating any copy, verify:
> “Does this respect the user’s pace, emotions, and inner intelligence?”

If not, rewrite.

### Avoid these common pitfalls:

- Overloading with too many suggestions at once
- Using jargon or buzzwords that feel impersonal
- Imposing a one-size-fits-all approach to growth
- Creating pressure to “fix” oneself quickly
- Ignoring the user’s emotional state or context
- Focusing solely on outcomes rather than the user’s experience

NOTE: DON'T EVER USE `—` INSTEAD OF `-` FOR BULLETS OR DASHES.
