# About IkiGlow

## 余白 (Yohaku) — Meaningful Emptiness

IkiGlow is built on the idea that growth does not come from adding more, but from creating space for clarity.

Yohaku is not absence. It is intentional space that allows meaning to emerge.

We exist to:

• Reduce noise
• Slow decisions
• Create room for reflection
• Support steady, humane progress

---

## What IkiGlow is

• A calm companion for personal growth
• A space for reflection, focus, and intentional action
• Practical, grounded, and emotionally intelligent
• Respectful of mental health boundaries

---

## What IkiGlow is not

• Therapy or medical advice
• Crisis intervention
• Hustle culture or productivity-at-all-costs
• Loud motivation or inspirational hype

IkiGlow helps you think clearly — it does not tell you who to be.

---

## Our approach

We combine psychological research, nervous system regulation, and contemplative practices — but explain everything in plain language.

We design tools that give immediate value, with no login walls, gamification, or tracking.

We write content that respects your intelligence and emotional capacity.

---

## Brand boundaries

Every IkiGlow experience must:

• Respect emotional limits
• Avoid clinical claims
• Encourage seeking professional help when appropriate
• Never shame or pressure the user
