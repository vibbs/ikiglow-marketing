> Before we can change direction, we need to know where we're standing.

Most of us carry a vague sense that something is off. We feel stretched thin in some areas, completely absent in others. But we rarely stop long enough to look at the whole picture.

The Wheel of Life is a quiet way to do exactly that.

## What is the Wheel of Life?

It's a simple visual tool - a circle divided into segments, each representing a different area of life. 

The areas typically include:
- Health and body
- Work and career
- Relationships
- Personal growth
- Fun and recreation
- Physical environment
- Finances
- Family

These are common categories - not a rulebook. Your life may need different labels.

You rate each area from 1 to 10 based on how you feel about it right now. Not how it should be. Not how it compares to others. Just how it feels to you, today.

When you connect the dots, you see a shape. Rarely a perfect circle. Often lopsided. Sometimes surprisingly so.

## Why this works

We tend to think about our lives in fragments. Work stress. Health goals. Relationship worries. Each problem feels separate, urgent, and personal.

And underneath it all, there's often a quiet exhaustion - the weight of carrying too much without ever setting it down to look at it clearly.

The Wheel of Life does something different. It places everything on the same page. It lets us see patterns.

Maybe career feels like a 9, but health is a 3. Maybe relationships are thriving, but personal growth has been forgotten for months.

This isn't about fixing everything at once. It's about noticing. Noticing creates the conditions for change without forcing it.

## The Ikiglow Audit practice

At Ikiglow, we use the Wheel of Life not as a diagnostic, but as a gentle check-in. Here's a quieter way to use this tool:

**Step 1: Draw the wheel**
Sketch a simple circle. Divide it into 8 sections. Label each with an area of life that matters to you. Use the standard categories or choose your own.

**Step 2: Rate without thinking too hard**
For each section, ask: *"How full does this area feel right now?"* Mark a dot between 1 (center) and 10 (outer edge). First instinct only. No analysis.

**Step 3: Connect and observe**
Draw lines connecting your dots. Look at the shape that emerges. 

Don't judge it. Just notice.

**Step 4: Ask one question**
Look at the area with the lowest score. Ask yourself:

*"What would a 1-point improvement look like here?"*

Not a transformation. Just one point. One small shift.

Write it down.

## A small step that can help

**5-minute practice**

Find a quiet moment today. Draw the wheel on paper - not on a screen. Paper slows us down.

Rate each area quickly. Don't overthink. Then look at the shape.

Notice what surprises you. Notice what you already knew but hadn't named.

Sit with the shape for a moment. You don't need to decide anything yet.

That's enough for today. Clarity doesn't require action. Sometimes it just requires seeing.

*The Wheel of Life isn't about perfection. It's about awareness. And awareness, over time, changes everything.*
