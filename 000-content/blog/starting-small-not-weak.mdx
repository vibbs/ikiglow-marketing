## What's actually happening

We're taught that big goals require big effort. That starting small means you're not serious, not committed, not willing to do what it takes.

**But the opposite is true.**

Starting small isn't weak. It's strategic. It's how you build the foundation that actually lasts.

## The myth of the grand gesture

**The narrative we're sold:**
- Wake up at 5 AM
- Run 5 miles
- Write 1,000 words
- Meditate 30 minutes
- Start today, do it perfectly, never stop

**What actually happens:**
- You do it for 3 days
- You miss once
- You feel like you failed
- You abandon the whole thing

**The problem isn't your willpower. The problem is the starting point was too big.**

## Why small steps work (and big leaps don't)

### 1. Small is repeatable

You can sustain something tiny far longer than something massive.

**Example:**
- 100 pushups a day = unsustainable
- 2 pushups a day = laughably easy, but you'll actually do it

After 30 days of doing 2 pushups, you've built the habit of showing up. Now you can expand.

### 2. Small bypasses resistance

Your brain resists hard things. When a task feels overwhelming, you'll find reasons to avoid it.

But when something takes 60 seconds? Your brain doesn't even register it as a threat.

**This is the entry point.** Once you start, continuation is easier.

### 3. Small builds identity, not just behavior

Every time you do the tiny version of a habit, you're casting a vote for a new identity.

- 1 pushup = "I'm someone who exercises"
- 1 sentence = "I'm someone who writes"
- 1 minute of stillness = "I'm someone who practices mindfulness"

The behavior is small. The identity shift is significant.

## What "starting small" actually looks like

**Not:**
- Read 30 minutes a day → Read 1 page
- Exercise 1 hour → Put on workout clothes
- Journal every night → Write one sentence
- Meditate 20 minutes → Take 3 conscious breaths

Notice: These aren't goals. They're **entry behaviors**-the smallest action that starts the momentum.

## A practice that works: The 2-Minute Anchor

Pick one habit you want to build. Now shrink it to something you can do in 2 minutes or less.

**The rule:** You're not allowed to do more than the 2-minute version for at least two weeks.

**Why this works:**
- It removes the pressure to perform
- It builds consistency before intensity
- It proves to yourself that you can show up

After two weeks, if it feels automatic, you can gradually expand. But the foundation is already there.

## Why this feels uncomfortable (and why that's okay)

Starting small can feel like you're not doing enough. Like you're capable of more, so why hold back?

**Here's the truth:** You probably are capable of more. But capability isn't the issue. **Sustainability is.**

You don't need to prove you can do a lot. You need to prove you can keep showing up.

## The compound effect of tiny actions

**What happens when you write 1 sentence a day for a year?**
- 365 sentences
- That's several essays, maybe a book chapter
- More importantly: you've become someone who writes daily

**What happens when you do 2 pushups a day for a year?**
- 730 pushups
- More importantly: you've built the habit of moving your body
- Expansion becomes natural, not forced

**Small, repeated actions compound into significant change.**

## When to scale up (and when not to)

**Scale up when:**
- The small version feels automatic
- You catch yourself wanting to do more
- You've been consistent for at least 2-4 weeks

**Don't scale up when:**
- You're trying to prove something
- You feel guilty for "only" doing the small version
- Consistency is still shaky

**The goal is sustainability, not speed.**

## A story that illustrates this

**James wanted to get in shape.**

He tried the big approach: gym 5 times a week, strict diet, full commitment. It lasted 9 days.

Then he tried the small approach:
- Week 1: Put on running shoes every morning (didn't even leave the house)
- Week 2: Step outside in running shoes
- Week 3: Walk to the corner
- Week 4: Jog for 1 minute

It felt absurdly small. But six months later, he was running 3 miles, 4 times a week-without forcing it.

**The habit was already there. He just let it grow naturally.**

## A gentle reminder

Starting small doesn't mean staying small. It means building a foundation strong enough to support growth.

You're not settling. You're being strategic.

And that's not weakness. That's wisdom.
