## What's actually happening

Most habit advice tells you to "be disciplined" or "stay consistent." But willpower is a limited resource. The harder you grip a habit, the faster it slips away.

**Here's why:**
- Willpower depletes throughout the day
- Force creates resistance
- Effort feels unsustainable, so your brain finds ways to quit

You're not failing because you lack discipline. You're failing because the method itself is exhausting.

## The effort paradox

The more energy a habit requires, the less likely it is to stick.

**Think about the habits you already have:**
- Brushing your teeth
- Making coffee
- Checking your phone

You don't need motivation for these. They're automatic. They're wired into your routine.

**The goal isn't to build willpower. It's to remove the need for it.**

## The Ease-First Principle

Instead of asking, *"How do I force myself to do this?"*

Ask, *"How do I make this so easy I'd feel silly not doing it?"*

## A practice that works: Shrink it until it's laughably small

Most people start too big. They want to:
- Exercise 30 minutes a day
- Write 1,000 words
- Meditate for 20 minutes

But when you're building a new behavior, **the goal isn't performance. It's repetition.**

**The 2-minute rule:**
Scale your habit down to something you can do in 2 minutes or less.

**Examples:**
- Not "go to the gym" → put on workout clothes
- Not "write a chapter" → write one sentence
- Not "meditate" → take three slow breaths

Once you do this consistently, you can expand. But the foundation is showing up, not how much you do.

## What this looks like in real life

**Sarah wanted to start running.**

She tried the standard advice: "Run 3 times a week for 30 minutes."

It lasted 4 days.

**Then she tried this:**
- Week 1: Put on running shoes every morning (didn't even leave the house)
- Week 2: Put on shoes and step outside
- Week 3: Walk to the end of the block
- Week 4: Jog for 1 minute

Six months later, she was running 5K without forcing it. The habit was already there.

## Remove friction, not just add effort

If you want a habit to stick, don't just rely on discipline—**design your environment to make it easier.**

**Make it easy:**
- Put your book on your pillow if you want to read before bed
- Lay out your workout clothes the night before
- Keep a water bottle at your desk

**Make it hard (for habits you want to break):**
- Delete apps you overuse
- Put your phone in another room
- Use website blockers

**The principle:** Let your environment do the work so you don't have to.

## When to expand (and when not to)

Once a habit feels automatic—when you do it without thinking—you can gradually increase.

**But here's the key:** If you expand and it starts to feel forced again, **scale back.**

Better to do 5 minutes consistently than 30 minutes inconsistently.

## A gentle truth

You've been taught that discipline is about pushing harder. But sustainable change is about **making it so simple that effort becomes irrelevant.**

Stop grinding. Start easing in.

The habit will follow.
