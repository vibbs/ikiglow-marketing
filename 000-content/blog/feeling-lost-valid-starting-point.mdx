## What's actually happening

Feeling lost isn't a failure. It's a signal.

**It means:**
- You've outgrown an old path
- Your values are shifting
- You're between chapters
- You're honest enough to admit you don't have all the answers

Most people aren't as clear as they appear. They're just better at hiding the uncertainty.

## The pressure to have a plan

We're taught that success means knowing exactly where you're going. Five-year plans. Clear goals. Linear progress.

But real life doesn't work that way.

**Clarity often comes after action, not before it.**

You don't figure out the path by staring at a map. You figure it out by taking a step and seeing where it leads.

## The difference between lost and exploring

**Feeling lost says:** *"I should know, but I don't."*

**Exploring says:** *"I don't know yet, and that's okay."*

It's the same situation. The difference is how you frame it.

## A shift that helps

Instead of asking: *"What's my purpose?"* (overwhelming, abstract)

Ask: *"What feels meaningful today?"* (specific, actionable)

Purpose isn't a destination. It's a direction you adjust as you go.

## A practice that works: The Small Signals Method

When you feel lost, you're not looking for a complete map. You're looking for the next small signal.

### Step 1: Notice what energizes you

Over the next week, pay attention to moments when you feel:
- More alive
- Curious
- Engaged
- Like time moved faster

These aren't random. They're clues.

### Step 2: Notice what drains you

Also notice:
- What makes you feel heavy
- What you avoid or procrastinate on
- What leaves you feeling empty

These tell you what doesn't fit anymore.

### Step 3: Follow one small pull

You don't need a grand vision. You need **one thing that feels like a "yes."**

Examples:
- A topic you want to learn more about
- A person whose work resonates with you
- A skill you're curious about
- A problem you want to help solve

Pick one. Spend 10 minutes exploring it. See where it leads.

## What this looks like in practice

**Maya felt lost after leaving her corporate job.**

She didn't know what she wanted to do next. She just knew the old path didn't fit anymore.

Instead of forcing a plan, she followed small signals:
- She noticed she felt most alive when helping friends clarify their ideas
- She started a side project coaching people through decisions
- That led to a certification program
- Which led to her current work as a career coach

She didn't start with a map. She started with one small pull and followed it.

## Why comparison makes it worse

When you feel lost, it's easy to look at others and think, *"They have it figured out."*

But you're comparing your behind-the-scenes confusion to someone else's highlight reel.

**The truth:** Most people are navigating uncertainty too. They're just not posting about it.

## When to stop searching and start doing

You don't need complete clarity to move forward. You just need **enough clarity for the next step.**

**Ask yourself:**
- *"What's one small thing I could try this week?"*
- *"What would I do if I trusted I'd figure it out along the way?"*

Action creates clarity. Waiting for clarity before acting keeps you stuck.

## A gentle truth about direction

You don't find your path by thinking harder. You find it by:
- Trying things
- Noticing what resonates
- Adjusting as you go
- Trusting that clarity unfolds over time

**Feeling lost is not a problem to solve. It's a phase to move through.**

## When to seek support

If feeling lost is accompanied by:
- Hopelessness or thoughts that nothing matters
- Isolation or withdrawal from people and activities
- Persistent emptiness that doesn't shift

Please reach out to a counselor or therapist. Sometimes what feels like "being lost" is actually depression, and that's treatable.

## A reminder

Not knowing where you're going doesn't mean you're behind. It means you're standing at a new beginning.

The path doesn't appear all at once. It reveals itself one step at a time.

You don't need to see the whole map. You just need to take the next step.

And that's enough.
