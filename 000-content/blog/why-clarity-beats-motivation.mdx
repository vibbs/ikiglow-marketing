## What's actually happening

Every day, your brain makes thousands of micro-decisions. By the time you sit down to work on what matters, your decision-making capacity is already depleted.

This is called *decision fatigue* - a well-documented psychological phenomenon where the quality of your decisions deteriorates after making many choices, regardless of how important they are.

When you feel unmotivated, you're often experiencing the mental weight of unclear priorities. Your brain is stuck in decision-mode, not action-mode.

## The Clarity Over Motivation principle

**Instead of asking:** "How do I get motivated?"

**Ask:** "What's the next clear step?"

Motivation is an emotion. Clarity is a system. Emotions fluctuate. Systems persist.

## A small step that can help

**2-minute practice**

1. Write down one thing you've been avoiding.
2. Break it into the smallest possible next step.
3. Do that step now, or schedule it for a specific time today.

That's it. No motivation required. Just one clear action.
