## What's actually happening

You wake up ready to work on something meaningful. But first, you need to decide what to wear. Then what to eat. Then which email to answer first. Then whether to attend that meeting. Then how to respond to a text.

By the time you sit down to focus, you're not unmotivated-you're **mentally depleted**.

This is decision fatigue. Every choice you make, no matter how small, uses the same cognitive resource pool. By midday, that pool is shallow. By evening, it's empty.

When people say they "lack motivation," what they often lack is **available mental bandwidth**.

## The hidden weight of invisible decisions

You don't realize how many micro-decisions you're making:
- What to click on next
- Whether to respond now or later
- What task to prioritize
- Whether this feeling matters
- If you're doing enough

Each one is small. Together, they form a constant background hum that drains your capacity to engage with what matters.

**The result:** You feel stuck, foggy, and unable to act-even on things you care deeply about.

## A shift that helps

**Instead of asking:** "Why can't I get motivated?"

**Ask:** "What decisions can I remove today?"

Motivation isn't the problem. **Clarity is the solution.**

## A 2-minute practice

1. Write down one thing you've been avoiding
2. Ask: "What's the smallest first step?"
3. Remove every other decision until that step is done

**Example:**
- Not: "Work on the project"
- Instead: "Open the document and write one sentence"

That's it. One clear action. No decision-making required.

## What this looks like in practice

Let's say you want to exercise, but you "can't find the motivation."

**The real barrier might be:**
- You haven't decided when
- You don't know which workout to do
- Your gear isn't ready
- You're not sure how long it should take

**The shift:**
- Tomorrow at 7 AM, you'll put on your shoes and walk for 10 minutes
- No other decisions required

Now it's not about motivation. It's about following a clear instruction you already gave yourself.

## Why this works

Your brain has two modes:
1. **Planning mode** (high energy cost)
2. **Execution mode** (lower energy cost)

When you remove decisions in advance, you shift from planning to execution. This conserves energy and makes action feel easier.

**The formula:** Less deciding = more doing.

## A gentle reminder

If you're feeling unmotivated, you're not broken. You're not lazy. You're carrying a cognitive load that's heavier than you realize.

The answer isn't to push harder. It's to **lighten the load**.

Start with one clear step. That's all you need.
