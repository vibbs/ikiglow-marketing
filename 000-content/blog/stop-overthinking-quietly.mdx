## What's actually happening

Trying to force your mind to be quiet is like trying to hold a beach ball underwater. The harder you push, the more forcefully it resurfaces.

This is called **thought suppression**, and research shows it backfires. The more you try not to think about something, the more your brain fixates on it.

**You can't stop thoughts by fighting them. You can only change your relationship with them.**

## The trap of mental control

When you tell yourself, *"Stop overthinking,"* you're adding another layer of thinking on top of the original thought.

Now you're not just thinking about the problem-you're also thinking about the fact that you're thinking about the problem.

**This creates a loop:**
1. Thought appears
2. You judge yourself for having the thought
3. You try to suppress it
4. The thought returns stronger
5. Repeat

## A shift that helps

**Instead of asking:** *"How do I stop thinking?"*

**Ask:** *"What do I do when a thought shows up?"*

You're not trying to eliminate thoughts. You're learning to let them pass through without getting stuck.

## The Notice-Allow-Redirect practice

This is a simple, repeatable pattern for working with overthinking.

### Step 1: Notice (without judgment)

When you catch yourself overthinking, pause and name it:

*"I'm noticing overthinking."*

Not: *"I'm overthinking again, what's wrong with me?"*

Just: *"This is overthinking."*

Naming it creates distance. You're observing the thought, not becoming it.

### Step 2: Allow (stop fighting it)

Don't try to push the thought away. Let it be there.

Think of it like a cloud passing through the sky. You don't need to grab it or shove it away. You just watch it move.

**Say to yourself:**
*"This thought can be here. I don't need to fix it right now."*

This doesn't mean you like the thought. It means you're no longer adding resistance to it.

### Step 3: Redirect (gently shift attention)

Once you've noticed and allowed the thought, redirect your attention to something physical.

**Examples:**
- Feel your feet on the ground
- Take three slow breaths
- Notice five things you can see
- Move your body (walk, stretch, shake your hands)

You're not suppressing the thought. You're choosing where to place your attention next.

## What this looks like in practice

**Overthinking moment:**
*"Did I say the wrong thing in that meeting? They probably think I'm incompetent. I always do this. Why can't I just be normal?"*

**Old approach (fighting it):**
*"Stop thinking about this! It doesn't matter! Just move on!"* → Thought returns stronger.

**New approach (Notice-Allow-Redirect):**
1. Notice: *"I'm overthinking the meeting."*
2. Allow: *"This thought can be here. I don't need to solve it right now."*
3. Redirect: *Take three breaths, feel feet on ground, return to present task.*

The thought might return. That's okay. You repeat the process. Each time, you're training your brain that thoughts don't require immediate action.

## Why this works

Your brain is designed to solve problems. When you give it a thought, it wants to process it.

But **overthinking isn't problem-solving. It's looping.**

When you notice, allow, and redirect, you're teaching your brain:
- This thought doesn't need to be solved right now
- I can feel this discomfort without acting on it
- I have the ability to choose where my attention goes

Over time, the loop weakens.

## When thoughts feel urgent

Sometimes overthinking disguises itself as urgency: *"I need to figure this out NOW."*

**Ask yourself:**
- *"Is this actually urgent, or does it just feel urgent?"*
- *"What would happen if I set this thought aside for 10 minutes?"*
- *"Can I do anything productive about this right now?"*

If the answer is no, you have permission to redirect.

## A tool that helps: The thought shelf

When a repetitive thought won't let go, try this:

1. Write it down on paper or in your phone
2. Tell yourself: *"I've captured this. I'll come back to it later if needed."*
3. Set a specific time to revisit it (e.g., tonight at 7 PM)

This externalizes the thought. Your brain can relax because it knows the thought is "stored" somewhere.

Often, by the time you return to it, the urgency has faded.

## A gentle reminder

You're not trying to become someone who never overthinks. You're becoming someone who knows how to move through it without getting stuck.

The goal isn't a quiet mind. It's a mind that can be noisy and still allow you to function.

That's enough.
