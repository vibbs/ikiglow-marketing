## Your mind isn't broken. It's trying to solve something.

You replay conversations. You run through worst-case scenarios. You wake at 3 AM analyzing a decision you made three years ago.

This isn't weakness or irrationality. Your brain is doing what it evolved to do: scan for threats, solve problems, and avoid future mistakes.

The problem isn't that you think. It's that your thinking has become a loop—one that consumes energy without producing solutions.

This guide will help you understand overthinking and offer practical ways to interrupt the cycle.

## What's actually happening when you overthink

### Your brain is stuck in planning mode

Overthinking happens when your mind shifts into problem-solving mode but can't find resolution. So it keeps running the same analysis, hoping for a different answer.

This is called rumination—repetitive thinking without forward movement.

### Uncertainty triggers the loop

Your brain craves certainty. When it can't predict an outcome, it generates more thoughts to fill the gap. The more uncertain you feel, the more your mind spins.

Overthinking often isn't about the thought itself—it's about intolerance of not knowing.

### It's reinforced by temporary relief

Thinking through something can feel productive. It gives you the illusion of control. But when overthinking becomes chronic, you're no longer processing information—you're avoiding feeling.

The loop continues because it provides short-term anxiety relief, even though it increases long-term distress.

## Common misconceptions about overthinking

### "I just need to stop thinking so much"

You can't force your mind to be quiet. The more you try to suppress thoughts, the more they return. This is called the rebound effect.

Instead of stopping thoughts, you need to change your relationship with them.

### "Overthinking means I'm smart or careful"

Thoughtfulness is valuable. Overthinking is different—it's repetitive, unproductive, and often disconnected from action.

Smart thinking leads somewhere. Overthinking circles back to the same place.

### "If I think it through enough, I'll figure it out"

Some problems can't be solved through thinking alone. They require:
- Action (testing instead of planning)
- Time (letting clarity emerge)
- Acceptance (releasing control over the outcome)

Overthinking often delays these more effective strategies.

## What actually helps: The Notice-Name-Shift system

This framework helps you work with your mind instead of against it.

### 1. Notice (Catch the loop)

You can't change what you don't see. The first step is recognizing when you've entered the overthinking cycle.

**Signs you're overthinking:**
- Replaying the same thought repeatedly
- Feeling stuck in your head
- Physical tension (tight chest, clenched jaw)
- Time passing without awareness
- Energy draining without progress

**Practice:** Set gentle check-ins throughout the day. Ask, "Am I solving, or am I looping?"

### 2. Name (Label what's happening)

Naming your mental state creates distance from it. This is called cognitive defusion—separating yourself from your thoughts.

**Instead of:** "I can't stop thinking about this"
**Try:** "I'm noticing overthinking happening"

**Instead of:** "This thought is true"
**Try:** "I'm having the thought that [content]"

This small shift reminds you that thoughts are mental events, not facts.

### 3. Shift (Redirect attention)

You can't stop thoughts, but you can move your attention elsewhere.

**Practical redirects:**
- Body: Take three slow breaths, feel your feet on the ground
- Movement: Walk, stretch, shake out tension
- Sensory: Notice 5 things you can see, 4 you can hear
- Action: Do one small task related to what you're overthinking about

The goal isn't to avoid the thought—it's to prove to your brain that you're safe enough to move forward.

## Practical exercises

### Exercise 1: The thought dump (5 minutes)

When you catch yourself overthinking:

1. Write down every thought in the loop (don't filter)
2. Read what you wrote
3. Ask: "Is this thought solving something, or repeating?"
4. Circle any thoughts that suggest an action you can take
5. Do one of those actions, or schedule it

This externalizes the loop and helps you see where thinking ends and action begins.

### Exercise 2: The decision boundary (2 minutes)

For recurring overthinking patterns, set a boundary:

**The rule:** "I will think about [topic] for [X minutes/until X time], then move on."

Examples:
- "I'll consider this decision until Friday, then I'll choose"
- "I'll give this 10 minutes, then I'll do something else"
- "I'll journal about this tonight, then let it rest"

Your brain needs permission to stop. Give it one.

### Exercise 3: The worst-case scenario completion (10 minutes)

If you're stuck in catastrophic thinking:

1. Write the worst-case scenario you're imagining
2. Ask: "If this happened, what would I do?"
3. Write a realistic response (not perfect, just possible)
4. Ask: "Can I handle that?"

Often, overthinking stops when you realize you could survive the thing you're afraid of.

## Reflection prompts

Take time to consider:

• When does my overthinking tend to happen? (Time, place, emotional state?)
• What am I usually overthinking about? (Past, future, relationships, decisions?)
• What does overthinking protect me from feeling?
• When I've moved past overthinking before, what helped?
• What would I do if I trusted myself to handle whatever comes?

## How to interrupt the cycle in the moment

When you notice overthinking happening:

**Don't:**
- Fight the thoughts
- Judge yourself for thinking
- Try to "figure it all out" right now

**Do:**
- Pause and take three breaths
- Name what's happening: "I'm overthinking"
- Ask: "What's one thing I can do right now?"
- Move your body or shift your attention
- Return to the present moment

Each interruption trains your brain that it's safe to stop looping.

## The role of unresolved emotion

Often, overthinking is your mind trying to avoid feeling something uncomfortable—sadness, fear, anger, grief.

When you notice persistent overthinking, ask:
**"What am I not letting myself feel?"**

Sometimes the loop breaks when you allow the emotion underneath to surface.

---

## When to seek professional support

If overthinking is:
- Interfering with sleep, work, or relationships
- Accompanied by persistent worry, panic, or dread
- Related to past trauma or intrusive thoughts
- Leaving you feeling hopeless or stuck for weeks

Please consider working with a therapist. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), and other evidence-based approaches are highly effective for overthinking patterns.
