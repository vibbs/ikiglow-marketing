## What this experience feels like

Anxiety can feel like your body is bracing for danger, even when you're sitting still.

Your chest might feel tight. Your thoughts might race. Your hands might tremble. You might notice your heart beating faster than usual, or a knot forming in your stomach.

Sometimes anxiety arrives with a specific worry. Other times, it's just a background hum of unease - a sense that something is wrong, even when you can't name what it is.

This is common. You're not broken. Your body is responding to perceived threat, even if that threat isn't immediate or visible.

## What it is

Anxiety is your nervous system's alarm system activating - often in response to uncertainty, past experiences, or perceived loss of control.

At its core, anxiety is fear of something that hasn't happened yet. Your brain is trying to protect you by scanning for threats, running through worst-case scenarios, and preparing your body to react.

This response evolved to help us survive immediate danger. But in modern life, it often activates in response to abstract concerns - deadlines, relationships, financial stress, health worries.

## Common misconceptions

### "Anxiety means I'm weak"

Anxiety is not a character flaw. It's a physiological response that happens to sensitive, thoughtful people just as much as anyone else.

### "I should be able to control this with my mind"

You can't think your way out of a nervous system response. Working with anxiety requires body-based practices, not just mental effort.

### "If I just avoid what makes me anxious, it'll go away"

Avoidance often reinforces anxiety. Gradual, gentle exposure combined with grounding practices tends to be more effective.

## What helps

### Regulate your nervous system

Slow breathing, grounding techniques, and body-based practices signal safety to your nervous system.

### Name what you're feeling

Simply labeling the emotion ("I'm feeling anxious right now") can reduce its intensity. This is called affect labeling.

### Move your body

Physical movement helps metabolize stress hormones. A short walk, gentle stretching, or shaking out tension can help.

### Reduce decision load

Decision fatigue amplifies anxiety. Simplify your day by reducing choices where possible.

## When to seek professional help

If your anxiety is interfering with daily life - work, relationships, sleep, or basic functioning - please consider reaching out to a mental health professional.

If you're experiencing panic attacks, persistent physical symptoms, or thoughts of self-harm, seek support immediately.

Anxiety disorders are highly treatable. Therapy, medication, or a combination of both can be profoundly helpful.
