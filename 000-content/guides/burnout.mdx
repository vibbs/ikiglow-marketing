## What this experience feels like

Burnout doesn't arrive suddenly. It builds quietly over weeks or months until one day, you realize you have nothing left.

**It might feel like:**
- Waking up already tired
- Caring less about things that used to matter
- Feeling emotionally numb or detached
- Simple tasks feel overwhelming
- A heavy sense that you're just going through motions
- Irritability or cynicism replacing your usual patience

This isn't laziness. This isn't weakness. **This is your system telling you it can no longer sustain the pace you've been keeping.**

---

## What it is

Burnout is chronic stress without adequate recovery. It's what happens when demands consistently exceed your capacity-physically, mentally, and emotionally.

**The World Health Organization defines burnout as:**
- Energy depletion or exhaustion
- Increased mental distance from one's work (or life)
- Reduced effectiveness

**Key insight:** Burnout isn't just about work. It can come from:
- Caregiving
- Chronic stress in relationships
- Financial pressure
- Ongoing uncertainty
- Persistent lack of control

**Your body and mind have limits. Burnout is what happens when those limits are repeatedly crossed without rest.**

## Common misconceptions

### "I just need a vacation"

A weekend off helps with fatigue. Burnout requires systemic change-not just time away, but addressing what caused the depletion in the first place.

### "Burnout means I'm not good at what I do"

Burnout often affects high-performers who care deeply. It's not a sign of incompetence-it's a sign you've been overextending without boundaries.

### "If I just push through, it'll pass"

Pushing through burnout makes it worse. Recovery requires intentional rest, boundary-setting, and often, structural changes to how you work or live.

### "Burnout is just being really tired"

Fatigue is physical. Burnout is systemic-it affects your emotions, motivation, sense of meaning, and physical health.

## What actually helps

### 1. Acknowledge what's happening

You can't address burnout if you're still telling yourself you're fine.

**Name it:** "I'm burned out."

This isn't giving up. It's recognizing reality so you can respond to it.

### 2. Stop, even when it feels impossible

The instinct is to keep going. But burnout requires rest-not just sleep, but a genuine pause from the demands depleting you.

**This might look like:**
- Taking medical leave
- Reducing work hours temporarily
- Declining non-essential commitments
- Asking for help with responsibilities

### 3. Identify what's draining you (and what you can control)

Not everything causing burnout is within your control. But some things are.

**Ask yourself:**
- What boundaries have I been crossing?
- What am I saying yes to out of obligation, not intention?
- Where am I over-functioning for others?
- What unrealistic standards am I holding myself to?

Even small shifts-like declining one meeting a week or asking for support-can create breathing room.

### 4. Reconnect with what restores you

Burnout disconnects you from what used to bring you energy. Restoration requires intentionally reconnecting.

**Small steps:**
- Spend time in nature
- Engage in gentle, non-productive activity (walking, cooking, creating)
- Connect with people who don't require emotional labor from you
- Allow yourself to do nothing without guilt

### 5. Address the root cause, not just the symptoms

If your environment, workload, or life structure is unsustainable, rest alone won't fix it.

**Long-term recovery often requires:**
- Setting clearer boundaries
- Reducing or changing commitments
- Addressing toxic work cultures or relationships
- Advocating for systemic change (if burnout is workplace-driven)

## Practical exercises

### Exercise 1: The Energy Inventory (10 minutes)

**Step 1:** List everything you do in a typical week
**Step 2:** Mark each item:
- ✅ Gives me energy
- ➖ Neutral
- ❌ Drains me

**Step 3:** Identify one draining item you can reduce, delegate, or eliminate

You won't be able to remove everything that drains you. But removing even one thing creates space.

### Exercise 2: The Boundary Practice (ongoing)

Pick one small boundary to practice this week:

**Examples:**
- "I won't check email after 7 PM"
- "I'll say no to one request I'd usually say yes to"
- "I'll take a full lunch break without working"

Start small. Boundaries feel uncomfortable at first, but they protect your capacity.

### Exercise 3: The Rest Ritual (daily, 10-15 minutes)

Create one non-negotiable rest practice each day-something that has no productivity goal.

**Examples:**
- Sit outside for 10 minutes
- Take three slow, intentional breaths
- Lie down and do nothing
- Stretch gently

This isn't "fixing" burnout. It's signaling to your system that rest is permitted.

## Reflection prompts

Take time to consider:

• When did I start feeling this way?
• What changed before the exhaustion began?
• What am I afraid will happen if I slow down?
• Where have I been over-functioning?
• What do I need that I'm not giving myself?
• What would recovery look like for me?

## The difference between burnout and depression

Burnout and depression can overlap, but they're different.

**Burnout:**
- Tied to specific stressors (work, caregiving, chronic demands)
- Often improves with rest and structural change
- You can still find meaning in other areas of life

**Depression:**
- Affects all areas of life, not just specific stressors
- Doesn't necessarily improve with rest alone
- Often includes persistent low mood, hopelessness, or lack of pleasure

**If you're unsure which you're experiencing, or if burnout symptoms persist despite rest, please consult a mental health professional.**

---

## When to seek professional support

You should consider professional help if:
- Burnout is affecting your ability to function daily
- You're experiencing physical symptoms (chronic pain, insomnia, frequent illness)
- You feel hopeless or numb most of the time
- You're having thoughts of self-harm
- Rest and boundary-setting aren't creating improvement

Therapy, medical evaluation, or workplace accommodations can provide critical support during recovery.

---

## The timeline of recovery

**Burnout doesn't heal in a weekend.** Depending on severity, recovery can take weeks to months.

**Early recovery (1-4 weeks):**
- Rest, reduce demands, basic self-care

**Mid recovery (1-3 months):**
- Rebuild routines, establish boundaries, reconnect with what matters

**Long-term (3-6+ months):**
- Sustain changes, prevent relapse, create sustainable rhythms

**Be patient with yourself. Healing from burnout takes time.**

---

## How to prevent relapse

Once you've recovered, prevention becomes essential:

**1. Monitor early warning signs**
- Irritability, fatigue, detachment, cynicism

**2. Maintain boundaries**
- Don't let old patterns creep back in

**3. Prioritize rest as part of your routine**
- Not just when you're depleted-proactively

**4. Reassess regularly**
- Check in monthly: "Is this sustainable?"
